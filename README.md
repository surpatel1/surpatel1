### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sur Patel! Welcome to my GitHub!

About Me:

I'm a student at Rutgers University majoring in Business Analytics & Information Technology and Economics with a minor in Public Health.

I enjoy journaling, reading, and meditating!

Portfolio of Work:

Recently, I have completed a project titled "Employment Statistics from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics" which is a visualization of employment statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics. Here, I combined my knowledge of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create this visualization.
